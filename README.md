Discord rich presence with CS:GO

## ABANDONED
This project is currently abandoned.
Most of it doesn't even work. I won't be providing any support for it.

## Instructions
- Download a release from [the releases page](https://github.com/hpyef/csgopresence/releases)
- Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Go to the directory where you downloaded the a release and run `npm install`
- Make a file in `<csgo install directory>/csgo/cfg` called gamestate_integration_csgopresence.cfg and paste [this](https://i.tooger.xyz/git/csgopresence/gamestate_integration_csgopresence) into it.
- If everything worked, you should now be able to use `npm start` to run it!
